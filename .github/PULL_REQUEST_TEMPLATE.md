I edited two typos: one in Subsetting Data and one in Functions. 

Furthermore, I would like to add a general comment: 

I personally would drop the references to previous shell lessons as R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis is a stand-alone lesson, and references to lessons not necessarily previously taught may make the learner insecure. 

For instance (Control Flow section): “We saw for () loops in the shell lessons earlier. »
